Please read before interacting!

BYI:

I refuse to harass anyone. Instead, I tend to block/hide people if they or their beliefs/interests make me uncomfortable, and that way no one gets hurt. 

PLEASE tell me if I've done something that makes you uncomfortable so I can know what I did and learn from it. I don't want to make anyone feel unsafe.

I struggle with tone sometimes. I'd appreciate the use of tone tags and I will gladly do the same if you'd like. 

IWC if meeting me for the first few times. New ppl make me nervous.

DO NOT INVOLVE ME IN DRAMA OR ASK ME TO PICK SIDES. 

My friend requests are off by default for internet safety and personal comfort. I will likely only add ppl as friends if we've interacted a decent amount of times.

DNI:

Basic DNI criteria (https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/)

Proshippers

Ships in general (by that, I mean shipping your avatar/character with me/my pony personally.) 

Shipping discourse DNI! I am very uncomfortable with the topic of shipping in general, and would rather not discuss it. 

S/H jokes, suicide jokes, slurs (ESPECIALLY ones you can’t reclaim).

Mean spirited jokes/rude/mean people in general

People 20+ UNLESS I ALREADY KNOW YOU OR HAVE YOU FRIENDED. 

Romantic intent/s3xu4l behavior. Even if you mean it as a joke, it makes me extremely uncomfortable! I also do not want to date anyone, I am very uncomfortable with romance as a whole.

I hide/block freely, and will not hesitate to hide you if you break my boundaries or make me uncomfortable. 

If you don’t like my boundaries, feel free to 

1. Block me, or
2. Refrain from interacting with me.

Here are some of my fandoms:

Pokémon (games and Indigo League) TADC, Billie Bust Up, Kid Icarus Uprising, ENA, Raggedy Ann, Dandy’s World, Splatoon, Bloodmoney, Murder Drones

I am in a lot of fandoms, so I likely forgot some. If you’re curious about whether I’m in any other fandoms, feel free to ask! ^^

Any questions? Whisper them to me on Ponytown!

If you read this far, whisper me a 🐛 on Ponytown! /nf ^^ have a good day :D
