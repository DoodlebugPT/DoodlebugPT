REVAMPED PROFILE RAAAAAHHHH

I fixed some formatting issues and added/updated information! 

Hiya, my name is Bug! I made this profile for Ponytown! ^^ Below is a basic overview and a DNI list, please read before interacting!

DISCLAIMER:

I refuse to harass anyone. Instead, I tend to block/hide people if they or their beliefs/interests make me uncomfortable, and that way no one gets hurt. The world needs less suffering.

PLEASE tell me if I've done something that makes you uncomfortable so I can know what I did and learn from it. I don't want to make anyone feel unsafe.

DNI:

Basic DNI criteria (https://dni-criteria.carrd.co/)

Proshippers

Ships in general (by that, I mean shipping your avatar/character with me/my pony personally.) also shipping discourse DNI! I am very uncomfortable with the topic of shipping in general, and would rather not discuss it. 

S/H jokes, suicide jokes, slurs (ESPECIALLY ones you can‚Äôt reclaim).

People 20+ UNLESS I ALREADY KNOW YOU OR HAVE YOU FRIENDED. 

Romantic intent/s3xu4l behavior. Even if you mean it as a joke, it makes me extremely uncomfortable! I also do not want to date anyone, I am very uncomfortable with romance as a whole.

I hide/block freely, and will not hesitate to hide you if you break my boundaries or make me uncomfortable. 

If you don‚Äôt like my boundaries, feel free to 

1. Block me, or
2. Refrain from interacting with me.

Basic overview of my nametags on Ponytown!

W2i: Whisper to interact. If this is in my name, I CANNOT SEE YOUR MESSAGES UNLESS YOU WHISPER. I‚Äôm likely offtab or just not paying close attention to the screen if this is in my name.

IWC: Interact with care. If this is in my name, I‚Äôm probably jittery and would prefer if you do not come at me too strong with spam boops, kiss emotes, lots of messages, etc. 

SV: Semi verbal. I likely won‚Äôt talk much if this is in my name, and will likely use emoticons, emojis, or ingame emotes to communicate. ^~^

COMF: The pony I‚Äôm playing as is my comfort character!

Here are some of my fandoms:

Pok√©mon, TADC, Billie Bust Up, Kid Icarus Uprising, ENA, Raggedy Ann, Dandy‚Äôs World, Splatoon, Sonic, Bloodmoney, Murder Drones, Yaelokre

I am in a lot of fandoms, so I likely forgot some. If you‚Äôre curious about whether I‚Äôm in any other fandoms, feel free to ask! ^^

I like interacting with people from my fandoms, or with people who are generally friendly, but I am a bit socially awkward and can be a bit nervous at first. I'd really appreciate if you use tone tags around me, it helps a lot.
 
I‚Äôm generally cool with C+H, but please don‚Äôt entirely cover me! ^^

ALSO! I do not accept friend requests on Ponytown often unless I‚Äôve interacted with you before or if I trust you. If you‚Äôd like to add me, I‚Äôd appreciate it if you asked me via a Ponytown whisper since my requests are off most of the time, and I selectively re-enable them. ^^

Any questions? Whisper them to me on Ponytown!

If you read this far, whisper me a üêõ on Ponytown! /nf ^^ have a good day :D
